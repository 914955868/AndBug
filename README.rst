=======================================
AndBug -- A Scriptable Android Debugger
=======================================


AndBug is a Java Debugging Wire Protocol implementation in Python, Pyrex and C intended to provide reverse engineers with a toolset for hooking, tracing and hacking Android Dalvik applications.  

Unlike JDB, Eclipse and JSWat, AndBug does not expect or require source code -- doing its best to let you work without requiring awkward shims like using Baksmali disassemblies as poor substitutes for the real file.  Also, unlike these other fine products, AndBug doesn't offer a GUI or even a CLI; you're going to have to get comfortable with Python.


Installation
------------

Don't. I'm not kidding. You really don't want to.  It'll maim your kids, it'll kick your dog.  It'll rip the tags off your mattress.  It's not ready, yet.


Examples
--------

See, your dog just got kicked. I wasn't kidding.
